# ImgInFuture
The goal of this project is to create a beautiful and easy to use image gallery for the future.
The images will be generated using an AI and all generated images will belong to the user that created them, including commercial rights.
I want to have a main page where anyone can see the last images generated and a page for each user where he can see all his images and download them
as well as a collections page where he can see all his collections and create new ones.

## Road map
- [x] Create a basic web page
- [ ] Create a beautiful web page
- [ ] Configure a CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Prepare to be integrated with any API as a source so maybe provide a sample API for this project?
- [ ] Listen to the community and add new features

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, you can do it in many ways:
- Open an issue, PR or comment on an existing one
- Share this project with your friends
- At the moment this is a project for fun, but if it gets traction I will try to make it a real business and I 
will need help with that, so if you are interested in that, let me know


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
